# 💰 Monity

**Monity** is a personal finance tracking app focused on clarity, accuracy, and real financial control.  
It helps users understand **where their money goes**, track **monthly income and expenses**, and correctly handle **recurring transactions** such as salary, rent, and subscriptions.

The app was designed from day one with **clean architecture**, **scalable structure**, and **financial precision**, avoiding common issues like floating-point rounding errors.
